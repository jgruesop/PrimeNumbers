## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).


## Exercise: Prime Checker Numbers

You are given a class Solution and its main method in the editor. Your task is to create a class Prime. The class Prime should contain a single method checkPrime.

The locked code in the editor will call the checkPrime method with one or more integer arguments. You should write the checkPrime method in such a way that the code prints only the prime numbers.

Please read the code given in the editor carefully. Also please do not use method overloading!
